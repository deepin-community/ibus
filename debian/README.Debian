ibus for Debian                           Osamu Aoki <osamu@debian.org>

=========================================================================
!
!      Keyboard mode switching is now changed to SUPER-space.  
!          The SUPER-key is commonly called windows-key.
!
!      X and ibus should be run under the UTF-8 locale 
!      to have stable behavior.  Set it via /etc/default/locale .

=========================================================================

* install required packages.
 - The input method helper package:        im-config
   - If you still have im-switch, please remove it while installing im-config.
 - Core ibus input package:                ibus
 - Support package for each UI environment
   - GTK2 IM module:                       ibus-gtk     (For old GTK app.)
   - GTK3 IM module:                       ibus-gtk3    (For new GTK app.)
   - Qt5 IM module:                        libqt5gui5   (for KDE5 app.)
   - Clutter IM module:                    ibus-clutter (optional)
   [Note]
     These are optional.  (Otherwise, xim is used)
     Installing them will improve user experience.
     Both ibus-gtk and ibus-gtk3 are required to set up usable system 
     with GTK.  GNOME and XFce use GTK.
 - Support package for each IM engine client
   - Japanese, MOZC (newer, heavy):        ibus-mozc
   - Japanese, KKC (newer, light):         ibus-kkc
   - Japanese, Anthy (older, light):       ibus-anthy
   - Japanese, SKK (EMACS style):          ibus-skk
   - Korean language:                      ibus-hangul
   - Traditional Chinese:                  ibus-chewing
   - Simplified Chinese:                   ibus-pinyin
   - Simplified Chinese (SUN):             ibus-sunpinyin
   - Chinese (array30):                    ibus-array
   - Chinese (cangjie):                    ibus-cangjie
   - Thai                                  ibus-libthai
   - Vietnamese:                           ibus-unikey
   - Many table based input method:        ibus-table*
   [Note]
     These are optional. But if you use any one of the listed language
     you need to install that one.

* configure im-config
  If other input method packages (fcitx, uim, ...) are installed,
  select ibus by executing im-config from a terminal window.
  (Usually not needed since this is default.)

* configure ibus
  - How to start configuration
    - GNOME3: use the GNOME3's keyboard setup dialog.
    - others: execute the ibus-setup command.
  - Add your input method explicitly via ibus configuration.
    - If you are on GNOME3, keyboard configuration offers both the basic XKB and
      fancy ibus based methods.  If you are not using standard US keyboard, make
      sure to set the XKB setting for keyboard first.
  - Setup XKB setting for ibus based input methods
    - The system wide keyboard setting is in /etc/default/keyboard. Change it:
      $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
    - If no XKB is set in the desktop configuration, some desktop system may
      set XKB system to "us" as the  default despite your system wide keyboard 
      setting.
    - The ibus based input methods inherit the XKB setting of the immediately
      previous input mode if it is set not to use the custom setup.  This is
      useful for people with keyboard settings which produce roman alphabets
      (German, French, ...) wishing to input Japanese etc.  But if the previous
      input mode is something like Russian, it breaks Japanese input method.
      So, if you have non-alphabet input via XKB, you need to lock your keyboard
      setting within the configuration of particular ibus method used, e.g.,
      ibus-kkc, ibus-anthy, ibus-pynyin, ....

* Always restart ibus if you changes its settings.
  If you are not sure how, exit your desktop environment and relogin to the
  user account to have a refreshed X session.
